Practiced class Components

Methods:

 ComponentDidMount:
// The componentDidMount() method allows us to execute the React code
// when the component is already placed in the DOM (Document Object Model).
//WE are telling the code to return updated in seconds state every second.
//We only call it once

ComponentWillUnmount:
//componentWillUnmount is used when there is a  timer

tick():
//Tick() provides the time in seconds that has passed since 1st of January of 1970. 
//It actually provides quite a few uses.
//This method is called every second.
